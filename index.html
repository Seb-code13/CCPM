            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This article helps to optimize project time. The CCPM technique is only suitable for projects with a high degree of complexity and uncertainty. To find out whether your project is valid, it is imperative to perform the test in the "CCPM TEST" section. </p>

                <p>To apply the CCPM method, It's important to plan all projects in advance. To do this, use planning tools such as GanttProject.<br>
                    PLEASE NAME YOUR TASKS WITH "_" instead of spaces, it will help for the rest. <br>
                For the planification you have to make a critical path for each project, make sure your planification is optimal. To learn more about GanttProject, click on the link GanttProject Tutorial, you will know everything you need.</p>

                <h3>Why using CCPM ?</h3>
                <img src="https://selimex.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/business-graphics-1056973-300x300.jpg" alt="Image de l'Article 2">
                <p>It's a project management method that basically focuses on managing deadlines and activities, considering the allocation of resources, based on the Theory of Constraints (TOC). <br>
                    CCPM avoids multi-tasking employees. After study, we noticed that an employee dedicated to a single task is more efficient. (We can see this from the SMED method, which is used in all areas to reduce the time taken to complete an activity).<br>
                    In addition, the CCPM optimises project time and employee efficiency. <br>
                    In this article, we will look at the steps to follow.</p>

                <h3>Critical Current Chain Method</h3>
                <p>Once you have planned your various projects on Ganttproject, make sure that the critical path has been completed for each project. <br>
                    Find the critical resource (it's a person) and put it forward.<br> <br>
                    For exemple this is 2 project of Creation of Website, planificated on GanttProject, every color means a different ressource. <br>
                    We can see both project have the same aspect and resources are multitasking.<br>
                    First as you can see the red color is the critical resources because it often appears. 
                 </p>

                <p>Now, you need to adapt the different projects according to the Critical Chain Method. <br> 
                    Take half the time allocated for each task and accumulate it at the end as 'buffer time' (pink color).
                </p>

                <p>Now you need to adapt the different projects according to the critical resource. <br>
                    You need to shift the project start date to take account of the critical resource.
                    You have to avoid multi-tasking on the critical resource.
